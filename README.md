# **Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Preparation**
## **Overview**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data preparation** using two datasets:  
1. **`white_wine_quality.csv`** – Contains physicochemical properties of white wine along with their quality ratings.  
2. **`shoppers.csv`** – Contains data related to online shopper behavior.

## **Key Features**
### **Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Load the datasets using `pandas`
- Handle missing values and clean data
- Generate summary statistics
- Visualize data distributions and relationships using:
  - Histograms
  - Scatter plots
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Boxplots

### **Part 2: Data Preparation**
- Handle categorical and numerical data transformations
- Normalize/scale data if necessary
- Feature engineering and selection for better model performance

## **Results & Insights**
- Visualizations provide insights into wine quality factors and shopper behavior.
- Data cleaning ensures datasets are ready for further machine learning applications.
